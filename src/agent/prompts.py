Hi Kyle!

Thanks again for the conversation - I hope this email will find you and Kim well. 

As a refresher we partner with property management companies / property owners and we ensure 100% compliance with renters insurance using automated technology - removing any burden that currently exists with renters insurance on your end. 

We also do this in a way that makes your company additional revenue. We are an insurance carrier that underwrites policies to the tenants and we operate with a very unique profit sharing model where we actually share a majority of the underwriting profits back to you. 

Basically we make renters insurance seamless for you and make you more money while doing it. 

I would love to hop on a phone call with Kim and tell her more. Or we could set up a time for one of y'all (or both) to meet with our head of partnerships and get a full visual demo (sales 101). We work around the clock so whatever time works best for you. 

Here are some additional resources to check out to learn a little bit about us and I will attach some documents for you guys to check out as well.

Thanks again for the nice conversation Kyle - it's always great to get a friendly person
on the other end of the phone. 

Have a great rest of the week!

Best,
