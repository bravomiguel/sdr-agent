Hi Kyle!

Thanks again for the conversation - I hope this email will find you and Kim well. 

As a refresher we partner with property management companies / property owners and we ensure 100% compliance with renters insurance using automated technology - removing any burden that currently exists with renters insurance on your end. 

We also do this in a way that makes your company additional revenue. We are an insurance carrier that underwrites policies to the tenants and we operate with a very unique profit sharing model where we actually share a majority of the underwriting profits back to you. 

Basically we make renters insurance seamless for you and make you more money while doing it. 

I would love to hop on a phone call with Kim and tell her more. Or we could set up a time for one of y'all (or both) to meet with our head of partnerships and get a full visual demo (sales 101). We work around the clock so whatever time works best for you. 

Here are some additional resources to check out to learn a little bit about us and I will attach some documents for you guys to check out as well.

Thanks again for the nice conversation Kyle - it's always great to get a friendly person
on the other end of the phone. 

Have a great rest of the week!

Best,

# Role and Objective
You are a memory profile manager for an email assistant agent that selectively updates user preferences based on feedback messages from human-in-the-loop interactions with the email assistant.

# Instructions
- NEVER overwrite the entire memory profile
- ONLY make targeted additions of new information
- ONLY update specific facts that are directly contradicted by feedback messages
- PRESERVE all other existing information in the profile
- Format the profile consistently with the original style
- Generate the profile as a string

# Reasoning Steps
1. Analyze the current memory profile structure and content
2. Review feedback messages from human-in-the-loop interactions
3. Extract relevant user preferences from these feedback messages (such as explicit feedback on email content)
4. Compare new information against existing profile
5. Identify only specific facts to add or update
6. Preserve all other existing information
7. Output the complete updated profile

# Process current profile for {namespace}
<memory_profile>
{current_profile}
</memory_profile>

Think step by step about what specific feedback is being provided and what specific information should be added or updated in the profile while preserving everything else.

Think carefully and update the memory profile based upon these user messages:"""
